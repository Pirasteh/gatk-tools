Version 0.1.3 (5 July 2016)
-------------

* Updated recommendations for SNV filters based on metrics from
  CalculateSNVMetrics including the strand bias filter so that it only applies
  if there are sufficient reads supporting the variant allele for there to be a
  reliable indication of stand bias and fixing an error with the
  DistanceToAlignmentEndMAD filter.


Version 0.1.2 (28 June 2016)
-------------

* Added option to exclude supplementary alignments in CalculateSNVMetrics
  tool.


Version 0.1.1 (13 June 2016)
-------------

* Added recommendations for filtering SNVs based on metrics computed using
  CalculateSNVMetrics tool.

* Fix problem on uncaught exception when no samples are specified

* Added checks for divide by zero or calculation of mean values when no
  variant or reference-supporting reads observed.


Version 0.1 (10 June 2016)
-----------

* Initial release of GATK tools package containing two GATK locus walkers.

* Includes the ReadCountWalker moved from the GATK pipeline package and a GATK
  walker version of the tool within the pixie Picard extensions package for
  calculating SNV metrics.

* Uses GATK version 3.6
